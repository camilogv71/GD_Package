# Gradient Descent Package

This is a package for implementing the gradient descent algorithm without the use of a third-party solver. 

# Installation

From the folder "GD_Package" run the command `python setup.py install`

# Default Parameters

If no parameters are given, the default values will be assumed:

* Maximum iterations as a stopping criteria: 10
* Tolerance as a stopping criteria: 0.0001
* Learning Rate: 0.1

# Function arguments

The `solve` function requires two arguments: the values of x_1 and x_2, which are the initial guess for the optimization.
